						Gloomhaven is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting
						motives.
						Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills
						and
						their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together
						out
						of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will
						enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and
						plunder,
						and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.

						Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through
						12-24
						sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts
						very
						similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the
						clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of
						four
						plagues before they get out of hand.

						In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the
						World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level,
						and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of
						those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting
						victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for
						advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.

						Civilization, with many changes small and large to the game's cards over its three ages and

						civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the
						right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be
						exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of
						antiquity and ending in the modern age.

						In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons
						forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great
						powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief
						before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this
						conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians,
						scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game
						simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare
						between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two
						titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins
						amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new "superpowers" scramble over the wreckage of the Second
						World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.
